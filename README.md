# Prospéro

Prospéro is a free and open-source platform for **textual data analysis**.

By combining [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)
and user-defined dictionaries to identify syntactic and semantic lexicons, it
allows to weight and classify thematic sets as well as argumentative and
narrative categories in time-evolving text corpora. Prospéro creators describe
it as a *literary technology for social sciences*.

## History

Prospéro 1 was designed as a desktop application in 1995 by the sociologist
**Francis Chateauraynaud**, director of studies at
[EHESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_for_Advanced_Studies_in_the_Social_Sciences),
and the software developer **Jean-Pierre Charriau**, also known as the former
bassist of [Marie et les Garçons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_et_les_Gar%C3%A7ons).
The version 2 of Prospéro with a client/server architecture was developed in
early 2010s with the contribution of **Josquin Debaz**, but it has never been
publicly released.

The collaborative project for **Prospéro 3** has began in november 2019 during
a one-week seminar in [Bayonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonne), southern
France, co-organized by [GSPR](http://gspr-ehess.com/) and
[Prefigura](https://www.prefigura.social/). This is the implementation of the
original theorical approach with advanced new features in a server-side
[API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) and a
client-side web applicaton.

The first stable released version of Prospéro 3 will
be online in the third quarter of 2020.
